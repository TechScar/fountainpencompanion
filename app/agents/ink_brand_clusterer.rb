    Your task is to determine if the given ink belongs to one of the existing
    brands or if it is a new one. If it is a new one, you should create a new
    brand cluster for it. If it belongs to an existing brand, you should add it
    to the corresponding brand cluster.

    * You will receive the ink name and a list of synonyms.
    * You will also receive a list of existing brands with their names and synonyms.

    You can determine patterns in the names and synonyms of the inks and brands that
    can help you determine if the brand of the ink is a new one or already present
    in the system.

    Synonyms for ink include, but are not limited to:
    * Spelling variations or typos
    * Different translations of the same name
